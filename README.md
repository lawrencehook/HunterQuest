# HunterQuest â€” [play it here](https://lawrencehook.github.io/HunterQuest/)
## A game by Jon Ting, Steven Wang, and Lawrence Hook
## Made for CS 4730 - Game Design at UVa

Hello!  Thanks for reading the readme.  In here, we will describe how to
play the game.  At its current state, it is still a prototype, and as a
result, has very limited functionality.  However, we hope that you will
still enjoy what we have to offer.

To begin the game, simply open index.html from inside the javscript
folder.  This should open the game in a browser window, and you should
be able to restart it by refreshing the page.  Our decision to use
javascript is so that in the future we can embed our game into a website
and increase the scope of people who can access our game.

The goal of the game is to proceed through the levels and defeat the evil
demon overlord that is attack your home village.  Only by defeating the
henchmen of the demon overlord can you power up and gain the strength to
vanquish him once and for all!
